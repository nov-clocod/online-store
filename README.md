## Description of the Project

This is a simple console based retail transaction application for small businesses. It allows users to browse 
products, add items to a shopping cart, view calculated totals, complete checkout with payment validation, 
and automatically generate receipt files for each successful transaction. The application provides an easier way 
to track sales and maintain transaction records.


## User Stories

- As a user, I want to have the option to see all products so that I can know what is available to buy.
- As a user, I want to have the option to view the products in my cart so that I can see how many products are in my cart and how much I need to pay.
- As a user, I want to be able to check out my cart and tells me if I have enough money, and receive a receipt after a successful transaction so that I can confirm my payment of what I purchased.
- As a user, I want the same products in my cart to be on one line with their quantity shown so that I don't have a long list of duplicate products on my receipt.
- As a user, I want a copy of the receipt to be automatically saved to a file named with the date and time of the transaction so that I have a record of purchases in case of any discrepancies.
